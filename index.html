    <!--Instructions
    You will create a simple game of chance using dice. The game begins with the
    player rolling five six-sided dice.

    If any die shows a 2 or a 5, no points are scored that turn. Those dice are
    set aside and cannot be rolled again. (They have "exploded" and are out of the game.)
    If no dice exploded this round, the player earns points equal to the face values
    of all rolled dice.
    The player re-rolls any "unexploded" dice and play continues with step 1.
    The game ends when all dice have exploded.

    Gameplay Requirements
    Display a graphical representation of the dice and what face is showing. Dice
    should look "dice-like", not just numbers printed to the screen.

    Exploded dice should have some visual indicator that they are out of play.

    The player's current score should be displayed and updated each turn.

    The player is notified when the game is over.

    Technical Requirements
    Use an array and/or objects.

    Create and use at least three functions.-->
